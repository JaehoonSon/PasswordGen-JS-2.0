<h1>About PasswordGen 2.0</h1>

<p>Unlike the previous password generator that I have created, I removed unnecessarily functions to make arrays, generate random numbers, etc</p>
<p>By default, this password generator will generate 20 character long password, so that it is nearly impossible to guess the password</p>

<h1>General Info</h1>
<li>There are 78 characters</li>
<li>Number of the characters can manually be adjusted</li>
<li>Just because it is named as "PasswordGen" it does not mean its sole purpose is to generate passwords, but this codes can be implemented to generate unique IDs, tokens, etc.</li>
